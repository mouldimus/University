As an inherent problem solver and challenge-seeker, 

As a sports retail business owner with a background in mechanical and electrical engineering, I've always gravitated towards problem solving which inevitably led me to computers as the world has become increasingly technocentric. Through studying computer science at your university, I hope to be....

## Motivation for Studying Computer Science
Ever since my dad told me that the games I played as a child were essentially 1s and 0s, I became intrigued by... 
As a kid I enjoyed reading magazines about the latest technology developments, and I still remember one especially innovative bracelet that used kenetic energy to... 
During my apprenticeship I thoroughly enjoyed panel wiring, troubleshooting and system maintenance. Later as a business owner, after our web developer quit, I taught myself the basics of computer programming to maintain our online store, which made me realise that programming was the ultimate problem to solve and that there was so much more to learn.

## Self-Learning Journey

While most of my learning has been through, hands-on tasks, reading code on my website, trying to understand, edit or fix it. I've also been though so many courses on Udemy, YouTube and I'm currently studying at Pitman-Training in Ipswich. Some of my favourite courses/tutorials have been:

- NetworkChuck - [you need to learn BASH scripting RIGHT NOW!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPwyp2NG-bE&list=PLIhvC56v63IKioClkSNDjW7iz-6TFvLwS) - YouTube
- NetworkChuck - [Linux for Hackers (and everyone) // FREE Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbEx7B_PTOE&list=PLIhvC56v63IJIujb5cyE13oLuyORZpdkL) - YouTube
- Kalob Taulien - [The Complete 2020 Fullstack Web Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/thecompletewebdeveloper/learn/lecture/20860824?start=1#overview) - Udemy

Honourable mention to ChatGPT, honestly since it has come out it's been a incredibly useful learning tool. It's also another reason why computers are amazing.

### Pitman Training - Web Developer Diploma
My time with Pitman Training has been the most informative and the most useful. It stripped everything right back to the *very basics* of how things work, which to start with was quite grating, but as the diploma and my career went on, I began to see the worth in taking things slow.

Here's a list of the core courses in the diploma and their completion:

- ✅ Computer and Technology Basics for Developers
- ✅ Overview of Software Development 
- ✅ Version Control
- ✅ HTML 
- ❌ CSS and Bootstrap
- ❌ JavaScript
- ❌ Managing Software Development Projects

I studied a professional coding bootcamp, so I could get back to my business as soon as possible. But I've found the further and further I got into the diploma, the further and further in depth I wanted -and needed to go. So this time I'm gonna go to University, study for 4 years, then come back to the business with the tools and skill set available to execute any idea we come up with.

## Why I Want to Attend University

When I think about the future of my career, I get so excited. I feel I have so much potential I could burst. I very regularly come up with new business ideas that could work *really* well, but I find often I don't have the skillset or the financial capital to carry the vision to reality. If I invest in my *intellectual* capital now, I'll be much more capable to bring those visions into reality later, without investing financial capital. It's gotten so bad I have a notes page on my phone, dedicated to these business ideas just in case I ever have the opportunity to start one.

I'm incredibly interested in machine learning and what I could do with it on the engineering front. I first formaly learnt about machine learning back in 2019, I stubbled accross a video on YouTube where a guy had used a generational evoulution machine learning algorithm, to simulate what how different species survive and evolve. 
There are so many interesting fields in computer science like AI, Quantum computing and image recognition I think they're all so 

I want to attend University, because I think a part of me still wants to be at the forefront of technology. I want to help shape the direction it takes, whether

## Unique Background 

Most of my friends decided to go to college, then university after school, but at the time I was unsure about what I wanted to do. In the end, I decided to work for a packaging machinery manufacturing company, now called Westrock Automation (previously Linkx Packaging Systems), as an apprentice. I studied Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, and I worked with a whole array of machinery. I worked there for 5 years, picking up a lot of *really* useful skills along the way, until one day I decided to help start a company, Sportstore Ltd.
