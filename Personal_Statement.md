# Thomas Hayward
#### Business Owner | Former Electrical/Mechanical Engineer | Aspiring Software Engineer

My name is Thomas Hayward, and I'm not your typical computer science applicant. As a sports retail business owner with a background in mechanical and electrical engineering, I've embarked on a unique journey that has led me to a passion for computer science. I hope this statement will prove to you that my passion for computers is genuine and I would make an excellent student.

## Motivation for Studying Computer Science
I've always loved computers. For a long time, I loved them just because they were fun to play games on, then one day my dad said computers are made up of 1s and 0s. I thought it was witchcraft! How a computer could understand a buch of 1s and 0s, and turn it into MarioKart. Then as I got older, I started using them for more and more technical tasks. Like bypassing the schools internet security system, using task manager to play online games(not my finest moment), or creating a fully comprehensive expenses spreadsheet 8 years in the making. This is when I realised computers were not just limited to games, they could do so much more. You could even run an entire business from a computer.

I think the love that I have for programming/problem solving now, has *always* been there, I could just never articulate *what it was that I loved*. For example, when I was in school I found I really loved excel spreadsheets; then, when I was doing my apprenticeship I fell in love with panel wiring, troubleshooting and system maintenance. It was only when I was running my own company, teaching myself the basics of computer programming, after our web developer quit, that I realised, I love programming, it was like the ultimate problem to solve, there is always so much to learn! And find out how it all works. I love programming. 

The more and more I learnt about programming languages, the more and more I realised I know nothing. There's this whole other category of languages out there, that run so much of the world we live in, and only 0.25% of the population that speak it! We need more computer nerds!

## Self-Learning Journey

While most of my learning has been through, hands-on tasks, reading code on my website, trying to understand, edit or fix it. I've been though so many courses on Udemy, YouTube and I'm currently studying at Pitman-Training in Ipswich. Some of my favourite courses/tutorials have been:

- NetworkChuck - [you need to learn BASH scripting RIGHT NOW!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPwyp2NG-bE&list=PLIhvC56v63IKioClkSNDjW7iz-6TFvLwS) - YouTube
- NetworkChuck - [Linux for Hackers (and everyone) // FREE Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbEx7B_PTOE&list=PLIhvC56v63IJIujb5cyE13oLuyORZpdkL) - YouTube
- Kalob Taulien - [The Complete 2020 Fullstack Web Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/thecompletewebdeveloper/learn/lecture/20860824?start=1#overview) - Udemy

Honourable mention to ChatGPT, honestly since it has come out it's been a incredibly useful learning tool. It's also another reason why computers are amazing.

### Pitman Training - Web Developer Diploma
My time with Pitman Training has been the most informative and the most useful. It stripped everything right back to the *very basics* of how things work, which to start with was quite grating, but as the diploma and my career went on, I began to see the worth in taking things slow.

Here's a list of the core courses in the diploma and their completion:

- ✅ Computer and Technology Basics for Developers
- ✅ Overview of Software Development 
- ✅ Version Control
- ✅ HTML 
- ❌ CSS and Bootstrap
- ❌ JavaScript
- ❌ Managing Software Development Projects

I only studied a professional coding bootcamp, to start with, so I could get back to my business as soon as possible. But I've found the further and further I got into the diploma, the further and further in depth I wanted -and needed to go. So this time I'm gonna go to University, study for 4 years, then come back to the business with the tools and skill set available to execute any idea we come up with.

## Why I Want to Attend University

When I think about the future of my career, I get so excited. I feel I have so much potential I could burst. I very regularly come up with new business ideas that could work *really* well, but I find often I don't have the skillset or the financial capital to carry the vision to reality. If I invest in my *intellectual* capital now, I'll be much more capable to bring those visions into reality later, without investing financial capital.

I'm incredibly interested in machine learning and what I could do with it. I'd love to learn more about 

## Unique Background 

Most of my friends decided to go to college, then university after school, but at the time I was unsure about what I wanted to do. In the end, I decided to work for a packaging machinery manufacturing company, now called Westrock Automation (previously Linkx Packaging Systems), as an apprentice. I studied Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, and I worked with a whole array of machinery. I worked there for 5 years, picking up a lot of *really* useful skills along the way, until one day I decided to help start a company, Sportstore Ltd.
